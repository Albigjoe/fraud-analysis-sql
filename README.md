üìä Fraud Detection Data Analysis Using SQL
This repository contains SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis on a fraud dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that differentiate fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones, identify high-risk users and channels, and quantify fraud rates by various dimensions like location, card type, and transaction method.
